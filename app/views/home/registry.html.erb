			<p>	Amazon is a full online registry that allows you to purchase universal items at the best possible price.  We've done our best to list items in the respective registry that offered the best price; however if you are able to find an item cheaper elsewhere, Amazon enables you to mark the item fulfilled by clicking the “Buying this gift elsewhere” link next to the "Add to Cart" button.</p>
