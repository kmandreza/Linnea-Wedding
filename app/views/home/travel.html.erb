			<h4><u>Flights</u></h4>

			<p>	The closest airport is San Diego Airport (code: SAN). If you decide to fly into LAX, it can take 2.5 - 4 hours to get to San Diego depending on traffic. From Orange County (code: SNA), it can take 1.5 - 3 hours depending on traffic. Traffic is usually pretty bad between LA / OC and SD. 
			</p>

			<p>	Suggested arrival: Friday, 31-May-2013 anytime.</p>
			<p>Suggested departure: Sunday, 02-Jun-2013 anytime. Monday, 03-Jun-2013 is one of the busiest flying days at SAN (especially the morning) so we recommend getting to the airport 2 hours in advance to go through security if you fly out that day.</p>

			<p><b>Bridal Party</b> - please arrive by morning of Friday, 31-May-2013 for the rehearsal.</p>
			<p><b>Family</b> - please depart afternoon of Sunday, 02-Jun-2013 or later. There is a family event on Sunday morning.</p>

			<h4><u>Weather</u></h4>
			<p>During this time of year, expect the weather to be a little chillier and the sky to be overcast.  Although San Diego is warm &amp; sunny most of the year, our wedding happens to be during "May Gray" and "June Gloom".  The marine layer may start to break up in the afternoon.  You'll still need your sunblock though.</p>

			<p>Average temps are in the 60s.  Highs in low 70s.  Little chance of rain.  Maybe we'll get lucky and it will be warmer.  We'll let you know closer to the date.</p>

			<p>Typical June day:</p><%= image_tag 'Weather.JPG', style: 'margin: 10px; float:left;' %>
