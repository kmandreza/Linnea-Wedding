<p>The closest airport to our wedding site is the San Diego Airport (code: SAN).  If you decide to fly into LAX, it can take you 2.5 - 4 hours to get to San Diego depending on traffic.  From Orange County (code: SNA), it can take 1.5 - 3 hours depending on traffic.</p>

<p>Suggested arrival: Friday, 31-May-2013 anytime.</p>
<p>Suggested departure: Sunday, 02-Jun-2013 anytime.  Monday, 03-Jun-2013 is one of the busiest flying days (especially morning) at SAN so we recommend getting to the airport 2 hours in advance to go through security if you fly out that day.</p>

<p>Bridal Party - please arrive by morning of Friday, 31-May-2013 for the rehearsal.</p>
<p>Family - please depart afternoon of Sunday, 01-Jun-2013 or later. There is a family event on Sunday morning.</p>
